This is a fork of the seeed studio code found here...

http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/File:MotorDriver20121210.zip

I am changing a few things around and removing some stuff, so this
will no longer function with the given examples. Hence their removal from 
this repository. If you install this you may want to give it another name
when you clone it, to avoid overwriting your original seeed drivers. I
left the name the same to be sure and let everyone know where the code came
from.

In case you are having trouble with getting the shield drivers to work, here
is what I did to install them...

1) Clone (or download the zip for the original drivers) the repository
 somewhere on your system...

git clone https://github.com/chriswood/MotorDriver MotorDriver_new

2) copy the ENTIRE folder under your libraries directory, in the arduino
   folder you have your sketchbook etc in. Or if you are using the arduino IDE
   you can just go to the libraries menu, click add a library, point it to this
   folder, and you are done.

3) Either use the "add library" tool in the arduino IDE, or just put this at
   the top of your sketch...
   #include "MotorDriver.h"

4) When you upload this to your arduino a new version should be compiled, but
   to be sure I would again name this something different.
